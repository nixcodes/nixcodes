# 👋 Hey there, I’m Nikil Balaji!

I enjoy automating things, building applications, thinking about exciting startup ideas and getting caught up with work of my existing projects.

I'm a software engineer in California, with a masters and bachelors in computer science. Started my career in Deloitte as a technology consultant but you know, coding is always exhilirating and I would love to do it all my life, apparently I'm not a amazing developer but I'm a great student, I learn things I find interesting and coding is one of em.

Apart from coding you can find me watching netflix documentaries (some you should watch is: Super Pumped, Steve Jobs, WeCrashed, The Playlist, The Billion Dollar Code, and fun fiction Silicon Valley)
